; This manifest runs multiple of the tests of the official
; "mozmill-tests" repository.

; None of the firefox tests should restart firefox itself. If firefox
; would restart, some kind of errors that RequestPolicy's might have
; possibly could not be detected. The reason is that a restart can
; "repair" some misbehaviour in RequestPolicy, but the intention of
; this test is to actually *find* those bugs.
